# Getting Started with Ninestars

This project is a clone of a bootstrap template.
It is my first React project. Since now I used Jquery.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### I used HTML5, CSS3, Reactjs, i18next and some more.
